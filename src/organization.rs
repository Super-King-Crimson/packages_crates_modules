        "===============Chapter 7: Managing Growing Projects with Packages, Crates, and Modules===============
        As projects expand in complexity and size, code organization becomes very important.

        Up until now, these lessons have been composed of a main file and the lessons were modules separated by file,
        but Rust can do so much more.

        A package can contain multiple binary crates and a library crate,
        which can be extracted to become external dependencies.

        There are also workspaces, but we'll talk about that later.

        We'll go over encapsulating implementation details, where code can be rewritten and called later
        without knowing exactly how that code works through the use of public and private data.
        This limits how much of your code you have to memorize (what can and can't be changed abt this?)

        Finally, we'll learn how to bring all stuff into a particular block of code by bringing it into scope.

        The features Rust provides to manage code organization is collectively called the module system, and include:
        - Packages
        - Crates
        - Modules
        - The use keyword
        - Paths
